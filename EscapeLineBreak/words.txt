Carol: Mushroom... Smile... They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny
蘑菇。笑一下。并不是所有人都像这样的，有些女人可能会把晚餐吃完的。对不起，这并不好笑。
Ross: No, it's just...you know the whole "getting on with your life" thing. Do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, you know, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talking to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to…you know?
不，这只是...人们老说要继续你的人生。我必须这样吗？我的意思是，我和这位美女坐在这儿，她是那么好，你知道的，但是，就这么吹了。我现在又和你聊天，轻松又有趣，而且，我不必...... 你知道的。
Carol: I know.
我知道。
Ross: Here's a wacky thought. What's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But let's...what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, okay? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it.Besides, I've got a ring at home that fits you. I've got lots of pictures with both of us in there. OK?And and and best of all, hey, hey, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep saying that, but there's something right here. I love you.
我有个疯狂的念头。我们再试一次怎么样？不不不，我知道你要说你是个女同志。但让我们......我们暂时不管这些。让我们把它摆在一旁，好吗？因为我们在一起很开心，你知道的，你不能否认。此外，我家里有一个适合你的戒指。我有无数我俩一起的照片。而且，而且，最美妙的地方是，嘿，你怀了我的孩子。我的意思是，这样不是很完美吗？但是，虽然你一直那样说，但是有种感觉在。我爱你。
Carol: Oh, I love you too. But...
哦，我也爱你，但是......
Ross: No but, no but.
没有但是，没有但是。
Carol: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you.
你知道，你摆在一旁的那件事，是时候把它拿出来了。你会找到那么一个人的，我知道你会的，合适的女人正在等着你。
Ross: It's easy for you to say, you found one already.
你说的倒轻巧，你已经找到一个了。

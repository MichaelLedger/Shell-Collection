Oh. I see-I see what you're saying.
我懂你的意思了。
Joey: Look, Ross, really, it's-it's no big deal. You know, you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we can't be friends at work, then, so be it. You know I understand, you know?
罗斯，真的，真的没什么。你知道你穿白色衣服，我穿蓝色制服，如果那代表着我们不能在单位成为朋友，那么不是就不是，我理解。
Hey, when I'm in a play and you're in the audience, I don't talk to you, right?
